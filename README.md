# DESI_SV
Repository for code relating to Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey validation and visual inspection.  This is currently just a place for me to play and edit codes, not a final polished version that would be useful to others.  
WARNING: Ugly code lives here (hopefully the ugly part is temporary).
